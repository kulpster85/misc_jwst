    "# Learning about which CRDS reference files were used to reduce data\n",
    "\n",
    "The JWST data pipeline automatically retrieves necessary reference files from the [Calibration Reference Data System](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu) and uses them to reduce data. Generally this is transparent to the user and behind-the-scenes. \n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes you want to look at and understand which reference files are used for a given reduction, and perhaps where they came from, or when. The pipeline records in FITS header keywords the CRDS reference files used in each data reduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "So it is straightforward (but a bit tedious) to look up those reference files in the CRDS web site and see their descriptive metadata.  The code in `misc_jwst.crds_ref_utils` automates that lookup.   \n",

The calibrations in these files have good absolute flux calibration values, in addition to the good detector-to-detector calibrations that were present in the previous version of the reference files. With the much improved absolute flux calibration, testing has shown that these values produce the expected color magnitude diagrams when working on commissioning and cycle 1 data. \n"
